# Introduction
This paper explores the challenges of solving optimization problems with multiple equally optimal solutions, highlighting the limitations of traditional algorithms like Genetic Algorithms and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), which are designed to find a single best solution. The ability to identify multiple optimal solutions is crucial for providing decision-makers with diverse choices. However, as the complexity of such problems grows, the number of optimal solutions can increase exponentially, complicating their identification.

## Key challenges include:

Ensuring diversity within the solution population to avoid overlooking potential optimal paths.
Addressing the high computational costs and memory usage of existing methods like niching, which divides populations into subgroups to locate multiple solutions.

## Proposed Method: Adaptive Multimodal Continuous ACO (AM-ACO)
The paper introduces AM-ACO, a novel approach that enhances traditional ACO for multimodal optimization by incorporating:
Niching Strategy: Divides the population into subgroups, each tasked with exploring specific solutions.
Adaptive Parameter System: Removes the need for manual parameter tuning, enabling more efficient and thorough exploration of solutions.

## Results and Benefits
Tested on 10 fitness functions, AM-ACO outperformed existing methods.
Identified more optimal solutions than competitors.
Maintained efficiency even for high-dimensional, complex problems.

The study highlights AM-ACO as a promising tool for tackling multimodal optimization problems with improved solution diversity and computational efficiency problems.
